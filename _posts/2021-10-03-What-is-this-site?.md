# Welcome to GaffHub... good luck escaping

I myself have yet to escape my vim enviroment, constantly typing away grinding my brain down to dust with  this site. It's not that much wokr but it is certainly a process. 
Making a site from scratch was defenitly harder. I tried doing that, I succeeded, and i never want to do it again. I will stick with jekyll thank you very much! Speaking of jekyll...

## How did he do it?
Well, I'm glad you asked! Too bad I don't know the answer. I kinda got jekyll, drank some coffee, and now I own a website I guess? Cafeene is amazing I tell ya... absolute wonders.
Anyways, here is a snippet of my \_config.yml

```yml
lang: en-US
title: GaffHub
email: gaffclant@gmail.com
description: Gaffclants Blog
baseurl: # the optional subpath of your site, e.g. "/blog"
url: "https://gaffclant.github.io" # the base hostname & protocol for your site e.g. "https://mmistakes.github.io"
author: #Gaffclant
  name: gaffclant
  picture: /assets/profile-pic.png
github_username: gaffclant
logo: /assets/logo.png # path of site logo, e.g. "/assets/images/logo.png"
search: true # true, false (default)
search_full_content: true # true, false (default)
search_provider: lunr
```

Neat huh?

## fin 
Thats about all I have for tonight. I will maybe tinker a bit, but I really only did this post to test if this whole thing works.
