# What have I been up to

I have been mostly focusing on school work and an organization call Technology Student Association. All I can say is that these projects are a hassle, and the TSA website is awful and we have very little communication to the people in charge. But it is fun to compete with technological skills so I play along anyways. 

I am very fond of the "Create electronic testing device" competition, as wiring stuff up an making something new that I can find use in is really fun. I can't say what I'm making, because that might reveal who I am which I prefer to stay a secret. I am also developing a game right now, but the github repo is private so you don't get to see :). Other than that I have not done much coding. However, me and [cody](https://codyq.me) have a plan to make something BIG. Something that will go on all my resumes and college applications! It is around 3 am when writing this so I am a little bit tired, but I shall push on! For the purpose of documenting whatever the hell it is I am doing!

### Non tech life
Outisde of technology, programming, and computers, I have actually gotten into anime a lot more. One of my favorite animes is "Dome X Kano" which I do NOT recommend anyone who knows me personally watch. Random people on the internet, go off but if I know you in PERSON do not watch this please. I have also watched Demon Slayer, Attack on Titan, Your Lie In April, Toradora, and a few more I don't remember off the top of my head. I have also started to play Skyrim a lot more recently, and I must say, it is the REASON I want an xbox one S for my birthday so I can actually play the anniversary edition.

## Goodnight
Thats all I have in me, I can't go on. I need sleep desperatly.
